                This is a slightly modified version of CS244B Mazewar which is a distributed, multiplayer game that allows each player to control a rat in a maze. A player receives points for tagging other rats with a projectile and loses points for being tagged.

                The goal of the project was to apply checks and constraints at the application layer to make UDP reliable. The checks were designed to deal with varying probabilities of packet drops, duplication, errors, re-ordering and any combination of the aforementioned. Since UDP is too reliable to test the correctness of the code (oh, the irony!) "BadNet" classes were provided emulating all possible faults that could occur during data transmission. The assignment was done in Python, and was tested with files of size 5 MB minimum.

                Blood drives may be common in universities and colleges in Pakistan, but there is a substantial lack of awareness amongst the general public about the importance of donating blood. The purpose of the site was to allow a central authority to obtain information about donors and supply it to blood banks or patients directly for cases where they urgently need donations. This would be especially useful in instances where the blood group is rare or a large number of donations are required immediately. This	project was done on a voluntary basis for Revolution Flame and is still a work in progress.

                <h4 class="company_details">Image Comparison using SSE Instructions</h4>
                
                I first came across SIMD instructions in my Computer Architecture course. The idea of using vector registers to improve performance seemed ingenious in its simplicity. I wanted to evaluate how fast SSE instructions could be in a realistic scenario. An application that could use data-level parallelism was image comparison. So I wrote three versions of the same application: one in Assembly, the second with SIMD instructions in Assembly, and the third with SIMD instructions with C++. On average, SSE instructions with Assembly ran twice as fast and SSE instructions with C++ ran almost thrice as fast as Assembly alone.

                A case-study on compilers was discussed as part of our Software Construction course in undergrad. The assignment was restricted to building only the front-end due to a lack of time. The lexical, syntactic and semantic phase were implemented to produce a symbol table for code generation from a file of C++ code.
